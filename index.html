        The Twin Cities Rose Club (TCRC) is a nonprofit organization and an affiliate member of the American Rose Society. Our mission is to promote the beauty and appreciation of our national flower: the rose. We achieve this through educational programs, informative meetings, and an annual rose show, which is free and open to the public. Each year in April, we also host a sale offering discounted roses and companion plants, as well as rose-related products (such as cocoa bean hull mulch) to supplement our low membership dues.
        </p>

        <div class="text-home">
        <p>The club has about 75 members and actively recruits new members through our booth at the Minnesota State Fair, member referrals, and our educational outreach to interested plant societies and individual gardeners.

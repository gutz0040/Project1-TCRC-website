        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The Twin Cities Rose Club (TCRC) is a nonprofit organization and an affiliate member of the American Rose Society. Our mission is to promote the beauty and appreciation of our national flower: the rose. We achieve this through educational programs, informative meetings, and an annual rose show, which is free and open to the public. Each year in April, we also host a sale offering discounted roses and companion plants, as well as rose-related products (such as cocoa bean hull mulch) to supplement our low membership dues.
        </p>

        <p>The club has about 75 members and actively recruits new members through our booth at the Minnesota State Fair, member referrals, and our educational outreach to interested plant societies and individual gardeners.
        </p>

        <p>TCRC holds meetings at the Good Samaritan United Methodist Church in Edina, Minnesota, on the third Friday of January, February, April, May, June, September, and October. For more details, please visit our <a href= "schedule-page.html" > schedule page</a>. Each meeting features a guest speaker, with past presenters being local rose specialists from other parts of the country. Additionally, every meeting offers a Rose Culture mini-seminar designed for beginner rose growers and exhibitors. If you're passionate about rose growing, you'll find our meetings enjoyable and informative!
